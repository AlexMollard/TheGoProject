# TheGoProject

## Introduction

TheGoProject is a repository dedicated to documenting my journey of learning the Go programming language from scratch. Following the structured approach outlined in [Quii's GitBook](https://quii.gitbook.io), this project aims to cover various aspects of Go, focusing on test-driven development (TDD) principles.

### Who is this for?

- Individuals interested in starting with Go.
- But mainly me to look back at how far I've come.

### What will you find here?

This repository will contain:

- **Code examples** corresponding to each topic covered in Quii's GitBook.
- **Explanations** and insights derived from my learning process.
- **Challenges faced** and solutions discovered during the journey.

### Prerequisites

To follow along, ensure you have:
- A computer with internet access.
- Go installed on your system.

### Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a chapter or topic from Quii's GitBook. Here’s a brief overview of what you’ll encounter:

- **Hello, World**: Writing your first Go program.
- **Fundamentals**: Covering integers, iteration, arrays, structs, pointers, maps, and more.
- **Concurrency**: Exploring Go's concurrency model.
- **Testing**: Introduction to testing in Go, including unit and integration tests.
- **Building Applications**: Creating web servers, handling JSON, routing, and more.

Some of the topics just mentioned may be split up into different folders if need be.

This README serves as a starting point for TheGoProject. As I progress through my learning journey, I plan to update this document regularly to reflect new topics covered and insights gained.
